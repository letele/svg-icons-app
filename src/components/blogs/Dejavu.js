                Moses was a profound South African pianist who believed in reincarnation. In the quote, he references Bheki Mseleku and is convinced that Bheki's talents where sharpened from a different lifetime. From Mseleku's discog, I'd pull out 'Celebration', and tell you that song comes from a different lifetime. Or 'Closer to the source', 'Love is the key', and 'Yanini' to convince you he had an aptitude for music. But how did he attain the natural talent?

                As I was reading through zero-The Biography of a Dangerous Idea, I came across the following: <br/><i> ...“Concealed in the heart of all beings is the Atman, the Spirit, the Self,” he says “Smaller than the smallest atom, greater than the vast spaces.” This Atman, which resides in every thing, is part of the essence of the universe, and is immortal. When a person dies, the Atman is released from the body and soon enters another being; the soul transmigrates and the person is reincarnated. </i><br/>
                On Earth, consciousness is contained in all living organisms. I know I exist, but I don't know where I am. This is probably the Atman. I know that when I die, my body will decay. But what about me, where do I go? Where do the accumulated talents go? Why is it that some have an aptitude for a talent and others don't? is it from the accumulations of previous lifetimes?

                The sun rises, the sun sets. We live, we die. Its a cycle. The sun rises, the sun sets. We live, we die. How do we break free from the cycle? We probably live because our soul is still attached to the pleasures and sorrows on this planet. "Honey, how do I look?". "I'm rich, your broke, and thats real homey". "Try this cologne, women like it." Does it mean if we made today we will still make it tomorrow? Not necessarily. Your success is a result of where and when you were born. This is due to inequality which unfortunatly is here to stay. But inequality only defines the pleasures and sorrows mankind faces. But what about the soul? We can't scale two souls. If we break free from what society thinks of us, then maybe there won't be force that pulls us back, and we will finally be part of a different dimensions with different settings.
