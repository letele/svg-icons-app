                I would like to express my interest for the vacant position in your company. Having committed hundreds to thousands lines of code to GitHub, I am assertive in typing on the keyboard and can stare at the monitor for hours and hours typing and deleting words that will, at the end of the day, add code on GitHub. I have no fear in deleting what I typed if it proves useless and acknowledge that all code is garbage. The latter may rhyme because it's true, but in all honestly I do not know what I am doing and as an employee, my job is to adapt to the employers environment and help best way I can as quickly as possible.               
            </p>
            <p className="mb-05em">
                Having used software such as SAS, Mat lab, JupyterLab, RStudio, PostgreSQL, Firebase, Windows98,    programming languages that include Python, R, JavaScript, CSS, and editors in the likes of Notepad ++, Sublime and VSCode, I am very very very decisive in data analysis and also have an eye for   aesthetics when developing functional web applications. From a card game like Hearts, to a Rubik  algorithm collector like cfop-algorithms, to npm packages such as hook-me-up and svg-icons, I try much as I can to diversify code I commit and I always track my edits   with the Global Information Tracker. Try me, and I will help alleviate the stress of realising    your ideas.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-05em">
                I greatly appreciate your time and consideration of my candidacy in your organization.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-05em">Sincerely</p>
